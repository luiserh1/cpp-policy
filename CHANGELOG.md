# Changelog

Each entry says what changed and why. Projects read this before moving their
`GIT_TAG` to a new release. Versioning rules: POLICY.md section 10.

## Unreleased

Changes from the first full walkthrough of the repository (2026-09-25). Item
numbers refer to that review's issue list.

### Documentation

- The version now has a single source (the `project()` version) and a release
  procedure; POLICY.md explains what `0.x` versions mean. *Why:* the version
  was written in three places and two were stale (the README still said
  v0.1.0, `project()` said 0.1.0 after v0.1.1 was tagged). (#14)

## 0.1.1

- `.clang-format` no longer re-wraps `NOLINT` comments. *Why:* a wrapped
  `NOLINTNEXTLINE` points at the wrong line (found in SimpleLocalServer).

## 0.1.0

- First release: policy document, CMake module, clang-tidy and clang-format
  configurations, suppression audit, presets and self-tests.
